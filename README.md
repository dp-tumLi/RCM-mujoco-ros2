# multipanda_ros2
## A sim- and real Panda robot integration based on the `ros2_control` framework

This project implements most features from the original `franka_ros` repository in ROS2 Humble, specifically for the Franka Emika Robot (Panda).
This project significantly expands upon the original `franka_ros2` from the company, who dropped the support for the Pandas.

Additionally, multi-arm mujoco simulation has been integrated, meaning you can now run the same controller on both simulated and real robots. 

Work is ongoing to integrate FR3 into the architecture.

As of 15.07.24, both the real and simulation robot interfaces are complete. GARMI (a robot platform with 2 panda arms and a non-holonomic base) is also available.

**This repository is a copy of an internal repo, that we try to keep up to date. Unfortunately, it means it doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should. We plan to migrate fully over to this public repo in the near future.**

## Documentation

Documentation for this project is available [here](./docs/main.md).

## Working (not thoroughly tested) features
More thorough information is available in the documentation.

* Real robot:
    * FrankaState broadcaster
    * All control interfaces (torque, position, velocity, Cartesian).
    * Example controllers for all interfaces
    * Controllers are swappable using rqt_controller_manager
    * Runtime franka::ControlException error recovery via `~/service_server/error_recovery`
        * Upon recovery, the previously executed control loop will be executed again, so no reloading necessary.
    * Runtime internal parameter setter services much like what is offered in the updated `franka_ros2`
* Sim robot:
    * Same as the real robot, except Cartesian command interface is not available, and there is no plan to implement this for now.
    * Gripper server with identical interface to the real gripper (i.e. action servers)
    * Example controllers for the real single-arm listed above, that correspond to those interfaces, work out of the box.
    * FrankaState implements the basics: torque, joint position/velocity, `O_T_EE` and `O_F_ext_hat`.
    * Model provides all the existing functions: `pose`, `zeroJacobian`, `bodyJacobian`, `mass`, `gravity`, `coriolis`.
        * Gravity for now just returns the corresponding `qfrc_gravcomp` force from mujoco.
        * Coriolis = `qfrc_bias - qfrc_gravcomp`

## Known issues
* Joint position controller might cause some bad motor behaviors. Suggest using torque or velocity for now.
* The default `franka_moveit_config` package depends on `warehouse_ros_mongo`, which has been deprecated. It has been changed to `warehouse_ros_sqlite` for now to ensure that `rosdep install` works properly. For now, please refer to this discussion [here](https://discourse.ros.org/t/fixing-moveit2-humble-moveit-ros-benchmarks-package/32048) for a potential solution; once a proper solution has been identified, it will be added.

## Using with Docker
1. Build the docker image:
    1. at the root of the repository (where `Dockerfile` is located), run 
        `sudo docker build -t "bimanual:garmi" ./`, or whatever name you want; just adjust them in the `docker-compose.yml` or the `docker run` command below.
    2. This installs all the required packages including `rosdep`.
2. Start the docker container with `docker compose` (for iGPUs):
    *   `xhost +; sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
        * `xhost +` is needed to give the Docker container access to the host's screen.
        * The `docker-compose.yml` file defines configurations that allow the container to run on the realtime kernel of the host, assuming that the host has one. The instructions were found in [here](https://github.com/2b-t/docker-realtime?tab=readme-ov-file).
        * Currently, running GUI apps outputs warnings in the console. Those can be ignored.
    *   Alternatively, with `docker run` (this has no RT kernel, so only the sim would work)
        ``` bash
        xhost +
        sudo docker run \
        -dit \
        -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
        --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \
        --env="DISPLAY=$DISPLAY" \
        --name=my_container \
        --network="host" \
        bimanual:garmi
        ```
        * The `--network="host"` is what enables the FCI IP address to be found from inside Docker without any additional configuration. TODO: Add a more elegant way to handle this.
    * For other GPUs, please refer online.
3. Access the container with:
    - for `compose`, `sudo docker exec -it realtime_humble bash`
    - for `run`, `sudo docker exec -it my_container bash`
4. (OPTIONAL) Check that the connection to the robot, RT kernel and screen are all working fine. 
    - You can check if docker is properly linked to your screen by running:
        - `ros2 run rviz2 rviz2` or
        - `~/Libraries/mujoco/bin/simulate`
    - For RT kernel and robot connection, run
        - `~/Libraries/libfranka/bin/communication_test <robot-ip>`

## Installation guide
(Tested on Ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Humble, Panda 4.2.2 & 4.2.1, `libfranka` 0.9.2 and MuJoCo 3.1.6)
On a computer running Ubuntu 22.04 and real-time kernel (if you wish to use it with a real robot), do the following:
1. Build `libfranka` 0.9.2 from source by following the [instructions][libfranka-instructions].
2. Build MuJoCo from source by following the [instructions][mujoco-instructions] (tested with 3.1.3).
3. Install library dependencies:
    - Install GLFW with `sudo apt-get install libglfw3;sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev`
    - Install [Eigen **3.3.9**](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases/3.3.9). Remove Eigen 3.4.0 if that was installed from following the `libfranka` steps.
        - Some functions will break if you use Eigen 3.4.0, and will fail to compile.
    - Install [`dq-robotics`](https://dqrobotics.github.io/) C++ version
4. Install ROS2 Humble by following their [instructions][humble-instructions] and create a workspace.
5. Clone this repository (i.e. the multipanda) into your workspace's `src` folder.
6. Install the dependencies by running this rosdep command from the workspace root: `rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src`
7. Export the `{mujoco/libfranka}/lib/cmake` directories as a `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` in your environment, i.e.
    - in `~/.bashrc`, `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH={path to mujoco installation}/lib/cmake}:{path to libfranka installation}/lib/cmake`
8. Source the workspace, then in your workspace root, call: `colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
    - The paths to mujoco and libfranka are added to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, so no separate args are needed.
9. Add the build path to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:{path to libfranka install}/lib:{path to mujoco's install}/lib`
    - The MuJoCo path is the INSTALLED folder's directory. The `lib` folder should only have the two `.so` files, and a folder called `cmake`.
    - Likewise, the `libfranka` path should contain the `cmake` folder and the `.so` files.
10. To run:
    - Single arm:
        1. with real robot, source the workspace, and run:
            - Default: `ros2 launch franka_bringup franka.launch.py robot_ip:=<fci-ip>`.
            - Multi-mode: `ros2 launch franka_bringup multimode_franka.launch.py robot_ip:=<fci-ip>`.
            - `arm_id` is fixed to `panda`.
        2. with sim robot, source the workspace, and run:
            - Default: `ros2 launch franka_bringup franka_sim.launch.py`.
            - Multi-mode: `ros2 launch franka_bringup multimode_sim.launch.py`.
            - `arm_id` is fixed to `panda`.
            - Currently, only the robot with gripper attachment is available.
    - Dual arm:
        1. with real robot, source the workspace, and run:
            - Default: `ros2 launch franka_bringup dual_franka.launch.py robot_ip_1:=<robot-1-fci-ip> robot_ip_2:=<robot-2-fci-ip> arm_id_1=<robot-1-name> arm_id_2=<robot-2-name>`.
            - Multi-mode: `ros2 launch franka_bringup dual_multimode_franka.launch.py robot_ip_1:=<robot-1-fci-ip> robot_ip_2:=<robot-2-fci-ip> arm_id_1=<robot-1-name> arm_id_2=<robot-2-name>`.
            - There is no default `arm_id`.
            - Grippers are set to true by default; add `hand_n=false` to disable this.
        2. with sim robot, source the workspace, and run:
            - Default: `ros2 launch franka_bringup dual_franka_sim.launch.py`.
            - Multi-mode: `ros2 launch franka_bringup dual_multimode_sim.launch.py`
            - `arm_id_1=mj_left` and `arm_id_2=mj_right` by default.
    - Garmi:
        1. with sim robot, source the workspace, and run:
            - `ros2 launch franka_bringup sim_garmi.launch.py`
